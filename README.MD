# 🚀 Joy of React – My Learning Journey 

Welcome to my personal learning journal as I deep-dive into **The Joy of React** course by Josh W. Comeau.  
My goal is to **master React** from the ground up, sharpen my frontend skills, and work toward becoming a **cracked engineer** at the top of my game.  
This repo will track my progress, notes, mini-projects, and experiments as I go through the course.
